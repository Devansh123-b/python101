# EX04 - Updating a Variable (COMMENTS ONLY)
#
# Goal:
#   Start with coins = 20
#   Then:
#     - Add 10 coins (found treasure)
#     - Subtract 4 coins (bought a potion)
#
# Print coins after each change, like:
#   Start: 20
#   After treasure: 30
#   After potion: 26
#
# Rules:
#   - Use the SAME variable name every time.
#   - Use coins = coins + 10 and coins = coins - 4 (no shortcuts yet).
